## Instructions

### Clone the repository

To clone the repository you have to specify the recursive parameter,
in this way:

`git clone --recursive git@github.com:<team_leader_username>/<main-project>.git`

All the submodules will be fetched from GitHub and they will be
placed inside the project root.

### Add a submodule

If you want to add a microservice (hence a submodule), you
have to run the command:

`git submodule add -b <branchName> <repoURL>`

### Pull the updates from all repositories

If a developer has pushed to <branchName> branch and you want
to pull the updates, you have to run the following command:

`git submodule update --remote`

#### Documentation

doubts about it, you can check the git-scm documentation
